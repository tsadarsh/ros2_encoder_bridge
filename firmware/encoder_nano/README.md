# Arduino Nano code for getting encoder ticks
Arduino Nano sends comma-seperated Int16 values of left and right encoder ticks.

## Pinout
| Nano Pin | Encoder Pin |
| --- | --- |
| D2 | A of left (from front) |
| D3 | A of right (from front) |
| D4 | B of left (from front) |
| D5 | B of right (from front) |
